Background Information and Sole Source Justification The NHLBI Murine Phenotyping Core requires an annual service agreement with Columbus Instruments for the maintenance, calibration, software updates, and repair of a specific list of scientific equipment designed and manufactured by Columbus Instruments and used by the Murine Phenotyping Core to phenotype mice for investigators NIH wide over the last 7 -10 years. The equipment, purchased from Columbus Instruments between 7- 10 years ago and used extensively in both acute and longitudinal studies, includes a Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Metabolic System and Cabinet (CLAMS), a 1 lane metabolic treadmill, two Eco 6 lane treadmills with shockers, and a Rotamex 4 lane rota rod, all with operating and analysis software. All of the equipment was designed by Columbus Instruments and the software used to operate it and analyze data is proprietary. The NHLBI financial and labor investment in purchase of this complex equipment and the extensive training of the Phenotyping Core staff to develop expertise in its operation and use is significant, and this is equipment will continue to be used in long term studies. No other vendor can repair, replace, or calibrate this Columbus Instruments equipment without voiding the warranty. Improper repairs or calibration could potentially damage this complex and expensive equipment and may introduce unacceptable variables into long range research conducted using this equipment. In addition, live research animals live inside of the CLAMS and are tested using the treadmills and rota rod and this equipment must be carefully calibrated by experienced and skilled technicians familiar with the design and operation, in order to assure that no harm comes to the animals, per regulatory requirements (NIH Guide, Animal Welfare Act, Office of Animal Care & Use), PHS Policy on Humane Care, etc.). No other vendor can repair or replace this equipment that was designed and manufactured by Columbus Instruments. The complete equipment list includes: CLAMS System 090501 CLAMS System 070447 4 Chamber Oxymax with Running Wheels Modular Treadmill Calibration (2) Exer 3/6 Treadmill Calibration (3) Rotamex-5 Grip Strength Meter Validation Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement We require annual service with Columbus Instruments for this equipment including technical support, labor, calibration, replacement, repair, or exchange of major components, sensors, scales, wiring, tubes, pumps, cage components, filters, motors, belts, shocker apparatus, and software updates to maintain the CLAMS, ECO 6 treadmills, and the rota rod in good working order. Based on 7 years previous experience with the wear rate and lifespan of certain components, we anticipate that we will need 1 annual on-site service visit with 2 days labor, plus repair or exchange of components that will cost approximately $17,605. for a one year period beginning December 1, 2023 and ending November 30, 2024.  Contractor Requirements We require the vendor to be able to repair or exchange Columbus Instruments equipment including a CLAMS with specific components such as a paramagnetic 02 sensor, a CO2 sensor, system sample pumps, scales, motors, pumps, belts, and to provide technical support and software updates, as needed to maintain the CLAMS, the temperature controlled cabinet, ECO 6 treadmiils and the Rota mex rota rod in good repair and calibration for use in acute and long term research studies on live mice.   Government Responsibilities The Murine Phenotyping Core personnel have the following equipment in use and follow recommended practices for daily operation and use, reporting problems to vendor technical representatives, and packing for repair or exchange as needed. CLAMS System 090501 CLAMS System 070447 4 Chamber Oxymax with Running Wheels Modular Treadmill Calibration (2) Exer 3/6 Treadmill Calibration (3) Rotamex-5 Grip Strength Meter Validation Reporting Requirements and Deliverables The Phenotyping Core staff will contact the vendor when equipment malfunctions or needs exchange or repair, request estimated costs, and once approved by the purchasing agent, will ship the necessary parts to the vendor, or request a service visit and labor, not to exceed the estimated total of the purchase order. The equipment is heavily used, but repairs are not always necessary on a quarterly basis, rather are scheduled when there is a break in the experimental schedule, or as necessary in the event of emergency repairs.",-1,Negative,"Notice of Intent to Sole Source.

52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)
Addenda - Evaluation
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The offers must contain a technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:                
(i).    TECHNICAL:
The contractor will be evaluated based upon their capabilities as they relate to the requirement, as well as their understanding of the project.
Sub-Factors:
Management:
An acceptable approach will demonstrate the offeror’s ability to support the Government’s requirements for the specified candidate placement.
Quality Assurance:
An acceptable approach will identify the actions employed to ensure compliance with performance standards in the SOW. Provide effective measures for candidate placement and procedures that demonstrate compliance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. Must show the ability to present candidates that meet IHS clearance requirements.
Customer Service:
An acceptable customer service plan shall address how the offeror will ensure their availability to the requiring department of the IHS facility. Must show the ability to respond to planned and urgent placement requests.
 (ii).   PAST PERFORMANCE
Sub-Factors: 
Relevance/Quality:
The offeror will be evaluated based upon the relevance and quality of past contracts/jobs performed and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered. More recent and more relevant performance has a greater impact in the Performance Confidence assessment than less recent and less relevant performance. The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.
NOTE: The Government reserves the right to contact any reference provided by the offeror in evaluating the offeror’s past performance. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to use any information that comes to the attention of the Government in evaluating the offeror.
Performance Confidence:
As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the past contracts/jobs evaluated, the offeror will be assigned a confidence rating to their Past Performance factor.  It is the Government’s assessment of the offeror’s probability of meeting the requirements of the project based on the offeror’s experience level to projects similar in size and scope to this requirement.
 (iii).  PRICE:
Total evaluated price will be calculated for evaluation purposes only and used to assist in determining the best value to the Government. The total evaluated price will be evaluated as follows:
Price Reasonableness: Determination whether it is reasonable and if the quotation reflects an understanding of the requirement. Price competition is expected to support the determination of reasonableness. This factor will be evaluated as identified in FAR Part 15.305(a)(1).
Balanced Pricing: Unbalanced pricing is referenced at FAR Part 15.404-1(g).
Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or underestimated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. Offerors are cautioned that offers that are determined to be ""materially unbalanced"" may result in the offer being rejected because the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.
Best Value-Trade Offs: The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the low priced quoter if another superior technical submission, or a submission indicating a reduced performance risk, warrants paying a premium. As non-price factors are evaluated closer to one another between quotes, price will become more significant. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to award no order at all, depending on the quality of the quotes, the availability of funding and the continued existence of the requirement.

Description
This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued, and quotations will not be requested.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to award a fixed price contract with a nine-month base period from 11/1/2023-8/31/2023 to CareDx Lab Solutions, Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania 19382 on a sole source basis to provide the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) reagents to the Department of Transfusion Medicine/Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Lab at the NIH Clinical Center (CC).
The function of the Human Leukocyte Antigen Laboratory (HLA) of the Department of Transfusion Medicine, CC is to (1) provide clinical diagnostic laboratory testing for patients in the Clinical Center to facilitate possible transplant or enrollment into an appropriate protocol for the patient’s particular condition; (2) to conduct clinical consultations for Clinical Center physicians in the management of patient care in regards to potential transplant scenarios; (3) to maintain accreditation through various accrediting agencies in order to provide quality results (4) to conduct research in the development of new diagnostic laboratory tests (5) to facilitate the support and development of protocols which involve HLA testing and the implications for patient care.
The CareDx AlloSeq NGS kits provide the highest level of resolution available for HLA tying.  CareDx reagents are the only reagents that have been extensively tested and validated for use on the existing Illumina MiSeq instrument in the HLA Laboratory to provide the required three field resolution necessary for the NIH transplantation protocols serviced.  The high resolution enables the HLA Lab to provide the clinicians with the most complete information when searching for donors for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  The higher the resolution, the better the chance of success for the transplant. Testing validation requires parallel testing with known samples and would involve up to two months of testing and additional funding to purchase the reagents.  The American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI) is the accrediting organization for HLA testing, and the current validation of the CareDx reagents has met all standards required.
This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstance of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.
Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this posting. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Comments to this announcement, referencing this posting number, may be submitted to the CC, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, prior to the closing date specified in this announcement, electronically to the attention of Shasheshe Goolsby, Lead Contract Specialist, shasheshe.goolsby@nih.gov by October 23, 2023, at 6:30AM EST.

This is a Notice of Intent to award a sole source, firm-fixed price  order under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by 13.106-1(b)(2)  - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements and is not a request for competitive proposals. 
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Xpect Solutions, Inc. 11350 Random Hills Road, Suite 800, Fairfax, Virginia 22030.   
The Office of Biodefense Research and Surety (OBRS) has an integrated, enterprise electronic security management system providing COTS card access/entry control, visitor management and integrated video imaging/badging in conjunction with security alarm monitoring and control (intrusion detection), and Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) with alarm call-up and digital video recording in a single system platform. The system is Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) compliant and provides a high measure of safety and security to personnel and property as well as safeguards information as part of this agency’s statutory responsibilities.
Since the current system is not to be replaced, NIAID requires follow-on services with maintenance support of existing systems and components.
This acquisition is a follow-on for Security and Emergency Preparedness Maintenance services for systems utilized by NIAID Office of Biodefense Research and Surety (OBRS), Surety and Preparedness Coordination Branch, including access control systems (ACS), video imaging systems, closed circuit television (CCTV), various security detection and initiating devices, and perimeter detection, among others.  This acquisition is to maintain these systems and overall physical security infrastructure, which together provide critical support to numerous NIAID-wide campus customers.  These maintenance and installation services require onsite coordination and tie in to the existing NIAID campus security network management systems, requiring a high level of technical expertise/skill sets, such as Certified System Engineer ICAM PACS (CSEIP) certification.
NIAID requires the procurement of Xpect Solutions services to continue to provide security and emergency preparedness maintenance for a 4-month period.   These services will be procured through GSA under Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Special Item Number (SIN) 541330SEC – Security System Integration, Design, Management, and Life Cycle Support Services, with Other Direct Costs (ODCs) procured via the open market. ODCs are required to support this requirement as various components/products will be required for the vendor to perform maintenance and repair services on these NIAID systems.  Examples of potential ODCs: locks, cameras, switches, modules, security panels, power supplies, card readers, and other components/parts of NIAID systems.
Period of Performance: November 1, 2023 – March 1, 2024.
Place of Performance: Multiple NIAID buildings across six Maryland locations.
The North American Industry Classification (NAICS)  for this acquisition is 541330– Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $25.5 million. Xpect Solutions, Inc. is an SBA Certified Small Disadvantaged business.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition basis with Pakolatus LLC – 1120 Whistler Ave, Baltimore MD 21223.
Program (TRP) (collectively “Program”) requires off-site storage to maintain Emergency/Pandemic Preparedness Supplies and the storage of critical caging and cage components required to sustain vivarium operations. Specifically, a secure warehouse is needed to store and transport critical supplies required to ensure the continuity of operations for the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and TRP vivarium. Program currently has items and equipment stored at a secure warehouse with Pakolatus LLC in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area. Program needs to continue this current storage/warehouse and transportation service and also expand the available storage space.
Program has certain requirements and thus needs to maintain the use of storage with Pakolatus LLC, which is biomedical research service company specialized in business of storage and transportation, and has comprehensively secured facility which meets the government’s storage warehouse requirements. Furthermore, the company has warehouses in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan areas that is close to NIH Bethesda, which allows for a one-day turn around for the delivery of stored supplies, a service which is at no charge.  Program needs to continue using this vendor since we currently already has items and equipment stored at this facility. Program is expanding the storage space to add more items/equipment and keep everything in the same place.  Switching to a different vendor would require moving the items & equipment currently being stored to a new facility and/or would require splitting up the items being stored among multiple facilities. This would be extremely time consuming and cost additional money since items would need to be transported to a new warehouse and all of the items and equipment would need to be inventoried.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has a requirement for the following:
1,225.00 square feet of storage space & transportation, for 12 months from 11/01/2023 to 10/31/2024. Free labor and transportation. The warehouse must be a secured facility with ventilation, smoke/fire detectors & extinguishers, and pest/vermin control that can handle the storage the potentially sensitive and expensive scientific items and equipment.
Misc requirements:
Free 24hr turn-around transportation of goods, coming from storage warehouse to the institute’s loading docks, and vice versa to the storage warehouse.
Pest management program (critical for the storing of vivarium supplies).
Security surveillance measures in place.
Place of Performance or Delivery:
Period of performance is 11/1/2023 – 10/31/2024.
The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 1901 (a) (1) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1 only one responsible source and no other supply of service will satisfy agency requirements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  All responsible sources that could provide the required may submit a capability statement that will be considered by email (subject line to reference NOI-NIAID-23-2195934) by 4:00 pm eastern standard time on October 16, 2023.

The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the Indian Health Service’s (IHS) intent to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price sole source contract with Applied Statistics & Management, Inc. located at 92592-8277 for the continuation of services for access to software and related applications, necessary to ensure safe, quality care to IHS’s American Indian/Alaska Native Patients.
The current contract was issued to provide for standardization of IHS credentialing and privileging services utilizing the ASM software awarded. Competitive replacement action was previously anticipated without the initial need for a bridge. However, during the development process, the IHS determined that support services element should be federalized.  Extended discussions occurred to determine what elements should be handled by federal personnel.  Failures in the existing software approach caused a revaluation of the implementation strategy, considering whether the current approach of an on-premises installation is sustainable as the market has shifted to a web services business model; pursuing a FEDRAMP approved web services vendor or continue with the on-premises service model and assessing whether the IHS OIT is able to service a FEDRAMP implementation or whether an on premises version is the best approach. Following internal discussion, it has been determined that an on premise approach will minimize cost and risk to the IHS. Due to this determination, additional time is required to allow for revision to the acquisition strategy, and allow for a competitive follow on. Additionally, this bridge will allow for a transition period, if needed, to the competitive five year follow on.
This bridge will provide access to the following for a six (6) month period.
MD-Staff (web based credentialing), inclusive of E>priv, Pronto (electronic survey, hospital, and peer reference verification), Web Crawler for primary sources verifications, and MD-Staff App.
MD-App.
Virtual Committee, inclusive of MD-Query.
Operations and Maintenance Support.
Project Management necessary to oversee the operations and maintenance support efforts.
Only one (1) source Applied Statistics & Management, Inc. is capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirement during the extended period. Applied Statistics & Management, Inc. is the only source of providing the software currently in use. A change to this this software will require knowledge transfer, data conversion, and a re-training of hundreds of IHS staff located throughout the United States and the additional time granted through this bridge will help minimize risk during this potential process.
The total estimated cost of this service is $73,500.00

TARGET AUDIENCE: Diagnostic Testing Services Industry (Private Sector Clinical Laboratories)
I.  BACKGROUND
To improve the efficiency and accuracy of lab testing during and out of a public health emergency (PHE), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) aims to enhance laboratory quality, safety, and science by improving key laboratory processes and coordination between internal and external partners. Depending on the type and scale of an outbreak or PHE, laboratory testing could be performed entirely at CDC, expanded to include public health laboratories (PHL), or enhanced by partnering with private sector clinical laboratories to achieve widespread national capacity.
Engagement with the clinical laboratory community has been used for surge testing support in different capacities for three (3) recent PHE responses: the Zika response utilized regional clinical laboratories; the Mpox response utilized a set of commercial  clinical laboratories with nationwide reach; and the COVID response utilized broad nationwide testing in commercial and hospital clinical laboratories and many non-traditional testing sites, such as pharmacies. These recent experiences have proven that engaging with private sector laboratories significantly increases the nation’s resources and diagnostic capacity beyond what is available between CDC and the PHL system. Commercial laboratories leverage sophisticated, nationwide logistical operations that can move specimens from anywhere in the United States to a site with expertise and/or capacity, and can accession and process large volumes of tests performed on high-throughput instrumentation. Additionally, there are other laboratories, such as those affiliated with academic medical centers, that have specialized expertise, high containment facilities, and unique capabilities that may be useful depending on the emergency.
In learning from previous PHE responses, CDC would like to better prepare for future responses by enhancing the state of readiness for high-volume diagnostic testing. To do this, CDC would like to partner with private sector laboratories that have the capability, scalability (i.e., capacity), and willingness to collaborate with CDC to develop and rapidly scale-up testing when a pathogen of concern emerges, even before a PHE would be declared. Such a formalized collaboration, once established, would ensure that mechanisms are in place before a PHE exists to facilitate coordination between the federal government (CDC) and private partners, thereby accelerating the implementation of private-sector surge diagnostic testing ideally to tamp down an outbreak before it becomes a widespread emergency and certainly during a PHE.
II.  PURPOSE
The purpose of this RFI is to ascertain the level of interest and capacities of private sector clinical laboratories for coordinating with the CDC to establish pre-event collaborations. Responses to this RFI may be used to inform potential pre-event agreements and strategies that can be used to support activities for these public-private partnerships.
III.  OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this RFI is to understand the type of support, cost, and resources needed for private sector laboratories to provide test development and surge diagnostic testing support prior to and during a PHE, as well as to determine what method, such as formal agreements via Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), contracts, or otherwise, would be best to execute this arrangement with private sector laboratories to meet response needs depending on the type and scale of the emergency.
IV.  REQUIREMENTS
CDC seeks information from organizations about their capability, proven experience, and capacity to develop and implement solutions to enable pre-positioned partnerships between private sector laboratories and public health and federal laboratories for enhancing surge diagnostic testing capacity in the event of a PHE. The agency asks for a summary response of no more than 10 pages, with three sections: (1) cover page; (2) approach; and (3) business information.
Section 1: Cover Page
Company Name
Company Address
Unique Entity Identification Number
Point of Contact information (email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing address)
Type of company under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), as validated via the SAM. Additional information on NAICS codes can be found at www.sba.gov. Any potential government contractor must be registered on the SAM located at http://www.sam.gov/index.asp
Identification as a large or small business. If small, indicate any additional classification.
Identification of services on any Federal Supply Schedules, if any, and the relevant schedule numbers.
Section 2: Approach / End-to End Solutions for Private Sector Partnerships with the PHL system and/or CDC
Describe what would be your organization’s approach to preparing to support test development and surge testing capacity, in collaboration with the CDC, to be leveraged when a pathogen of concern emerges that may become a PHE. Please consider providing details on the following and adding any other information you believe the CDC should recognize about your organization’s expertise and capacity, such as:  
Time frames necessary to develop tests for a new pathogen of concern, assuming CDC can or cannot provide to your organization clinical or contrived samples containing the pathogen
Lead time to move from test development to ramping up capacity to 10,000 tests per week and beyond, while maintaining your capacity to continue to serve patients testing needs for other healthcare concerns.
The geographic coverage for testing that your organization has in place now, including information on logistical mechanisms used to ensure rapid turnaround times of 2 days or less within that geographic area.
Your organization’s expertise in infectious disease testing—immunoassay, molecular, etc.—and optimizing tests for improved throughput and performance.
Your processes for ensuring appropriate biosafety.
Your workforce, supply, logistical, and other potential  costs and constraints that would challenge a rapid test development and response effort. (e.g., partnership costs, inventory, staff retention, appointment availability, automated reporting to submitter and public health, forecasting demand, etc.).
Existing relationships with local, state, territorial and/or tribal public health laboratories and agencies (e.g., department of health) in areas where you operate.
Describe preferred type of  agreements (e.g., MOU, contract, other) that could be established with CDC in advance of a PHE to expedite emergency response efforts and enable a more efficient scale up for surge testing. Please include any liability issues, constraints, and/or concerns to be considered.
Provide any additional suggestions for improving partnerships between public and private laboratories.
Provide testimonial(s) or proof of successful past performance of these capabilities, including volume of tests processed.
Section 3: Business and Pricing Model Considerations
To establish a warm-base test development and surge capacity agreement, describe your organization’s requirements for what you would consider a feasible minimum capacity level kept warm to sustain preparedness to rapidly develop and expand testing.
Describe coding, coverage, test payment, and other anticipated funding needs for long-term sustainability of surge testing support.
Describe the preferred mechanism for partnership (e.g., MOU, grant, contract).

To All NIH Contractors/Vendors,
On March 21, 2022, the NIH began a phased transition approach from the NIH Office of Financial Management (OFM) Electronic Invoice Submission instructions to the Department of Treasury’s IPP for electronic submission of payment requests.  All new contractors/vendors (Vendors) who have never done business with NIH will use IPP effective March 21, 2022.  All existing NIH Vendors will transition in “Waves” to IPP during the period March 2022 through March 2023.  This transition to IPP does not apply to grants or the Payment Management System (PMS).
Existing NIH awards are being bi-laterally modified to incorporate the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) clause HHSAR 352.232-71 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (February 2, 2022) in full text and provide instructions concerning the IPP transition.  Vendors should continue to use the existing NIH OFM email electronic invoice submission instructions until the Vendor transitions to IPP.  As a reminder, Vendors should not send hard copy invoices via mail to the NIH OFM (see Contract Opportunities Notice Amendment dated 11/5/2020, Subject:  NIH Will No Longer Accept Hard Copy Invoices Effective December 1, 2020). Hard copy invoices that are sent via mail to OFM will no longer be returned to the Vendors.
NIH Vendors in Waves 1A, 1B and 2 have transitioned to IPP.  NIH Vendors in Waves 3 through 5 will transition in the future.
IPP Vendor notification letters are being sent to the Vendor’s SAM.gov and IPP Points of Contact (POC).  These notification letters are being sent from the OALM NIH IPP mailbox (NIH-IPPinvoicing@mail.nih.gov) and will contain a subject line “National Institutes of Health (NIH) Transition to Invoice Processing Platform - Wave # Contractor/Vendor Notification”.
What Vendors Need to Do to Prepare For The Transition to IPP:
Ensure the Vendor’s SAM.gov account does not expire and that the Vendor’s SAM.gov POC is accurate and up-to-date. 
For Vendor’s with an existing IPP account:
Ensure the Vendor’s IPP POC is accurate.  Please contact the IPP Help Desk to make changes to the IPP POC.  The IPP website is https://www.ipp.gov.
Ensure the Vendor’s IPP POC can log into IPP and IPP password remains active.  If the Vendor experiences IPP log-in issues, please contact the IPP help desk for assistance. It is important that Vendors can log into IPP prior to their IPP transition date to avoid delays in submitting invoices due to IPP access issues. (Note:  NIH as an agency and NIH awards will appear in IPP after your company/organization has transitioned to IPP.)
For Vendors without an existing IPP account:
As part of the IPP Vendor Wave notification letter sent to the Vendor’s SAM.gov POC, the Vendor’s SAM.gov POC will be notified to register in IPP prior to their designated Wave transition date.
It is important that Vendors register in IPP as soon as they are notified and obtain the necessary user ID and password.
Vendors should verify that they can log into IPP prior to their transition date.
Vendors should contact the IPP help desk if log in issues are experienced. The IPP website is https://www.ipp.gov.
Continually check the Office of Acquisition and Logistics Management (OALM) IPP website at https://oalm.od.nih.gov/IPP for updates and important information.
IPP Modifications to Existing NIH Awards for Vendors in Waves 3 through 5
Existing NIH awards for Vendors in Waves 3 through 5 will be modified to include the following IPP invoice transition language, HHSAR clause 352.232-71 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (February 2, 2022) in full text, and the NIH OFM electronic invoice instructions:
NIH is using a phased transition approach from the NIH Office of Financial Management (OFM) Electronic Invoice Submission instructions to the Department of Treasury’s Invoice Processing Platform (IPP). This award will transition to IPP in the future. The Contractor/Vendor shall use the attached NIH OFM Electronic Invoice Submission Instructions until the Contractor/Vendor has transitioned to IPP as specified on the OALM IPP website at https://oalm.od.nih.gov/IPP.  It is the Contractor/Vendor’s responsibility to periodically check the OALM IPP website and be prepared to transition to IPP on the designated transition date. Questions concerning the transition to IPP should be directed to NIH-IPPinvoicing@mail.nih.gov. Questions concerning this award should be directed to the NIH Contracting Officer.
All IPP invoices must contain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) which is located in the System for Award Management (SAM) and replaces the Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.
If this award is a parent indefinite delivery award or a Blanket Purchase Agreement Set-Up, then HHSAR 352.232-71 applies to all task/delivery orders or Blanket Purchase Agreement calls issued under this award.
HHSAR 352.232-71 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (February 2, 2022)
Definitions. As used in this clause—
Payment request means a bill, voucher, invoice, or request for contract financing payment with associated supporting documentation. The payment request must comply with the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), ‘‘Content of Invoices’’ and the applicable Payment clause included in this contract.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests electronically using the Department of Treasury Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) or successor system. Information regarding IPP, including IPP Customer Support contact information, is available at www.ipp.gov or any successor site.
(c) The Contractor may submit payment requests using other than IPP only when the Contracting Officer authorizes alternate procedures in writing in accordance with HHS procedures.
(d) If alternate payment procedures are authorized, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officer’s written authorization with each payment request.

Introduction:
This is an RFI only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), will take procurement action in this matter. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information to assess the current “state of the science” in the field of vaccines.  Further, neither DHHS/NIH/NIAID nor the government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. 
Purpose:
This is a time-sensitive RFI, the purpose of which is to gather information on vaccine candidates in the areas identified below.  This RFI is being issued for the purpose of obtaining knowledge and information for project planning and market research purposes.
Broadly protective coronavirus vaccines (BPCVs) that target beta-coronaviruses, provide durable protection and/or immunity (superior to licensed vaccines for SARS-CoV-2) as well as breadth of immunity (i.e., high titer binding and neutralizing antibodies against recently circulating SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern, and SARS-CoV-1) and utilize technology platforms that are suitable for rapid pandemic response. Vaccine candidates should incorporate novel immunogens or delivery platforms and must elicit mucosal immunity.
Alphaviruses (excludes Chikungunya)
Filoviruses: Sudan ebolavirus, Marburg virus, Bundibugyo virus, especially vaccine candidates that demonstrate efficacy after a single dose in a relevant animal model.
Flaviviruses (except Zika, Dengue)
Orthopoxviruses: next generation vaccines for smallpox suitable for all ages and the immunocompromised that also protect against MPOX and that are not Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-based technologies. 
ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp)
Group A and Group B Streptococcus
Improved vaccines for S. pneumoniae and B. pertussis.
Vaccines to prevent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and/or tuberculosis disease.
Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis)
Optimal Valley fever vaccine candidates should align with specific criteria outlined in NIAID’s published strategy for Coccidioidomycosis (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/niaid-strategic-plan-for-research-to-develop-a-valley-fever-vaccine9.9.22.pdf)
Influenza vaccines designed to be protective against a broad array of Influenza A and/or B strains (e.g., “universal influenza” vaccines), pandemic influenza vaccines, seasonal influenza vaccines that offer significant improvements over currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccines.
Quadrivalent Shigella vaccines
Combination Salmonella vaccines
Neisseria gonorrhoeae vaccines
Vibrio cholerae with a focus on 2nd generation vaccines
Campylobacter jejuni
Combination vaccines to protect against two or more enteric bacterial pathogens, i.e., ETEC, Campylobacter, Shigella, Vibrio, Salmonella (iNTS, paratyphi A.)
Background:
Research supported by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. NIAID also has a key role in the development of new medical countermeasures (MCMs) against potential agents of bioterrorism, drug-resistant pathogens, and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Through a variety of research grants and contracts, NIAID’s Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics targeting multiple pathogens, including NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens which encompass Category A, B, and C priority pathogens (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens).
Information requested:
Organizations are invited to describe their research efforts involving vaccine candidates against any of the listed pathogens. Your comments may include but are not limited to: a) vaccine platform and antigen components, such as the development status, manufacturing capabilities, results of proof of concept immunogenicity and efficacy studies in relevant animal models, and the design and the results of any completed Phase 1 clinical trial(s); b) adjuvant component, if applicable, including development status of the adjuvant component, i.e. preclinical studies, clinical trial(s), and manufacturing capabilities; and c) the planned clinical indication(s) for use for the vaccine candidate.  The Government is also interested in the manufacturing status of potential vaccine candidates and likelihood that a Phase 1 or Phase 2 trial could be completed within 5 years. Organizations are invited to describe briefly the status of manufacturing processes including Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), scalability, and ability to complete and submit an IND.
Disclaimer:
This Notice shall not be construed as a solicitation or funding opportunity; a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction; or as an obligation on the part of the Federal Government and the NIH to provide support for any ideas identified in response to it. Submitting a request for these materials does not guarantee support for current or future studies. NIAID does not provide feedback on submitted responses.
Submitting a Response:
Responses should be limited to 3 pages for any given vaccine candidate, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents.  Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as such and will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. Submitted data and information will not be returned.
RFI responses must include: 1) Name and title of the primary point of contact for the response; 2) Name and address of the Institution or Company; 3) Email address and phone number of the primary point of contact.  Responses are due by 5 p.m. EDT on October 18, 2023.

52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The offers must contain a technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
                        (i).    TECHNICAL:
The contractor will be evaluated based upon their capabilities as they relate to the requirement, as well as their understanding of the project.
Sub-Factors:
Management:
An acceptable approach will demonstrate the offeror’s ability to support the Government’s requirements for the specified candidate placement.
Quality Assurance:
An acceptable approach will identify the actions employed to ensure compliance with performance standards in the SOW. Provide effective measures for candidate placement and procedures that demonstrate compliance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. Must show the ability to present candidates that meet IHS clearance requirements.
Customer Service:
An acceptable customer service plan shall address how the offeror will ensure their availability to the requiring department of the IHS facility. Must show the ability to respond to planned and urgent placement requests.
Key Personnel:
Acceptable candidate(s) shall meet or exceed the requirements established in the Statement of Work.  
(ii).   PAST PERFORMANCE
Sub-Factors: 
Relevance/Quality:
The offeror will be evaluated based upon the relevance and quality of past contracts/jobs performed and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered. More recent and more relevant performance has a greater impact in the Performance Confidence assessment than less recent and less relevant performance. The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.
NOTE: The Government reserves the right to contact any reference provided by the offeror in evaluating the offeror’s past performance. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to use any information that comes to the attention of the Government in evaluating the offeror.
Performance Confidence:
As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the past contracts/jobs evaluated, the offeror will be assigned a confidence rating to their Past Performance factor.  It is the Government’s assessment of the offeror’s probability of meeting the requirements of the project based on the offeror’s experience level to projects similar in size and scope to this requirement.
  (iii).  PRICE:
Prices contained in the price schedule must reflect total compensation for the services and must be fully inclusive of all costs including labor, travel, lodging, transportation, per diem, overhead, expenses, taxes, profit, et cetera.
Total evaluated price will be calculated for evaluation purposes only and used to assist in determining the best value to the Government. The total evaluated price will be evaluated as follows:
Price Reasonableness: Determination whether it is reasonable and if the quotation reflects an understanding of the requirement. Price competition is expected to support the determination of reasonableness. This factor will be evaluated as identified in FAR Part 15.305(a)(1).
Balanced Pricing: Unbalanced pricing is referenced at FAR Part 15.404-1(g).
Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or underestimated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. Offerors are cautioned that offers that are determined to be ""materially unbalanced"" may result in the offer being rejected because the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.
Best Value-Trade Offs: The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the low priced quoter if another superior technical submission, or a submission indicating a reduced performance risk, warrants paying a premium. As non-price factors are evaluated closer to one another between quotes, price will become more significant. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to award no order at all, depending on the quality of the quotes, the availability of funding and the continued existence of the requirement.

Description
This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to intends to award a follow-on fixed price contract with a base with four option years to HIL Global Corporation, Austin, Texas 78753 to provide Wayfinding Navigation enhancements and maintenance services.
The Clinical Center Office of Communications and Media Relations (OCMR), which includes patient recruitment, maintains a hospital wayfinding application solution for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center complex comprised of the Warren Grant Magnuson Building (Building 10), the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) and the Clinical Research Center (CRC).  The complex consists of 3.5 million square feet of mixed occupancy space in three congruent buildings on the NIH campus comprised of clinical, laboratory and administrative space.  This complex is composed of more than 5,000 rooms with 200 inpatient beds, 82-day hospital stations and 16 outpatient clinics.
The OCMR has a continued requirement for the digital wayfinding application as a means to control the flow of traffic to designated areas of the hospital, providing a way for the general hospital population to get to the right place without inadvertently coming into contact with potentially infectious patients.  This digital application helps health systems understand and improve the flow of patients and visitors as well as the patient experience at the hospital.  Enabling real-time indoor location and navigation is also a key strategy for health systems as they seek to implement a resilience strategy, which includes patients, visitors, staff, as well as digital and physical assets.
Connexient is the original developer of the Wayfinding navigation application.  Everbridge acquired Connexient in January 2020.  After Everbridge acquired Connexient, it sold the Wayfinding software application to HID Global Corporation.  HID Global has been providing software application maintenance and operation and enhancements.  If another vendor performs these services, it will cause a duplication of costs to government.
This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstance of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.

sources of supply (FAR 13.03-1). The BPAs have a 12-month ordering period and are reviewed for 
possible renewal each year.

you to submit quotations in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items 
prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and combined with FAR 13 Simplified 
Acquisition Procedures, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This 
announcement constitutes the only solicitation for quotes.

Background:  
The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences Branch (DCCPS), Healthcare Delivery Research Program (HDRP), National Cancer Institute (NCI) carries out the NCI Patterns of Care Studies.   The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patterns of Care (POC) studies describe, characterize, and compare practice patterns and treatments provided for cancer in different geographic areas of the United States. POC Studies are conducted to satisfy a Congressional directive (under Public Law 100-607, Sec. 413 (a)(2)(C) adopted on November 4, 1988) to the NCI to “assess the incorporation of state-of-the-art cancer treatments into clinical practice and the extent to which cancer patients receive such treatments and include the results of such assessment in the biennial reports…”. To satisfy the directive and to update and enhance the utility of the POC Studies, a working group including representatives from the NCI’s Divisions of Cancer Control and Population Sciences and Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis and a representative from the American Cancer Society was developed to review knowledge gaps in cancer therapy dissemination and to develop priority areas for study. The group reached a consensus that a gap remains regarding factors associated with guideline use of biomarker tests and targeted therapy. Furthermore, there is limited information about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and receipt of supportive/palliative care among individuals diagnosed with cancer and little information regarding treatment patterns for cancers of the small intestines. Therefore, this POC Study shall investigate patterns of care for patients with prostate, ovarian, and small intestines cancers.  The Study will also collect data on documentation of palliative care and patient financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the medical record.
Purpose and Objectives: 
The purpose of this acquisition is to collect data for the NCI Patterns of Care Study, relevant to the Congressional Mandate to NCI (Public Law 100-607, Sec. 413 (a)(2)(C) adopted November 4, 1988).  
The primary objectives of this POC Study are to: 1) describe the use of recommended biomarker tests which shall be verified with the treating physician/physician office staff or with a unified  medical record (record with all inpatient and outpatient records in a single file) or complete medical records (all inpatient and outpatient cancer treatment records obtained from more than one hospital/healthcare system/medical practice); and 2) describe the use of targeted therapy which shall be verified with the treating physician/physician office staff or with a unified or complete medical records. Other objectives are to: 3) describe the use of adjuvant therapy, which shall be verified with the treating physician/physician office staff or with a unified or complete medical records; 4) characterize the practice patterns in different communities; 5) compare the patterns of treatment: surgery, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, and other adjuvant therapy) over time and by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and insurance status; 6) describe comorbidities and the effect of co-morbid conditions on treatment; 7) describe treatment by hospital characteristics (i.e., for profit vs. not for profit, teaching vs. non-teaching, bed size, etc.); 8) describe the use of diagnostic tests and compare their use by demographic variables; 9) abstract information documented in the medical record on delays or changes in diagnosis, treatment, and supportive/palliative care among individuals diagnosed with cancer specifically due to the COVID-19 pandemic; 10) assess the incidence of cancer recurrence and metastasis following initial diagnosis; and 11) describe medical record documentation of patient financial impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic potentially affecting cancer care.

This notice is provided in accordance with FAR 5.203(a).
There is considerable evidence that the use of immunization information systems (IISs) can help to assess vaccination rates, inform public health interventions, and prevent vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).  IISs can enable public health officials to respond more efficiently to VPD outbreaks or other public health threats by quickly identifying geographic areas or populations that are not vaccinated, or who have not received all recommended vaccinations necessary to provide protection from one or more VDPs.  CDC has prioritized investments in advancing IISs and sees value in modernizing IISs to inform public health decisions. CDC demonstrates its commitment to advancing and modernizing IISs to improve the data quality by providing funding to support IISs under section 317b of the Public Health Service Act.  The Section 317 of the Public Health Services act provides the authority for CDC to issue the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) Immunization and Vaccine for Children (CDC-RFA-IP19-1901), to achieve section 317 priorities. CDC uses the Immunization Program Operations Manual (IPOM), a companion of the NOFO, to identify national IIS requirements and help jurisdictions prioritize their immunization management activities to meet them.   In addition to the NOFO, CDC has started directly procuring services from IIS technology partners, in a limited capacity, to assist jurisdictions that use a common IIS technology platform to achieve select Section 317 NOFO IPOM requirements and national goals for IISs and immunization management.
The services contemplated under this requirement are part of CDC’s goals to modernize and optimize IISs to achieve Section 317 Public Health Services Act objectives.  Through this contract, CDC will  procure information technology services from STCHealth in support of broader Section 317 IIS Information Technology (IT) infrastructure modernization priorities and that align to IPOM IIS requirements categories.  The scope of services for this acquisition encompasses the breadth of services and activities related advancing prioritized Section 317 IIS information management and infrastructure modernization efforts that improve the quality of IIS data. 
CDC intends to establish a sole source indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with each IIS technology partner. The Government is limited to using a sole source approach in order to align with the IIS technology partner each jurisdiction is already using for the support and operation of its IIS. In this way, the services procured under this portfolio of contracts will follow the existing IIS technology partner/jurisdiction relationship. To date, 52 out of the 64 state, territorial, and local IIS’s are operated and maintained by IIS technology partners. This requirement will be specifically for the following jurisdictions in which STCHealth is currently an IIS technology partner:

The authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1, ""Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."" Gainwell Technologies is the only entity capable of performing these services for the jurisdictions for which it currently provides IIS services. This is due to the fact that it would be disruptive and inefficient to have two IIS vendors or system integrators providing the same type of operations, maintenance and enhancement services to a single IIS. To use two vendors would cause a duplication of costs and would violate software development best practices. Therefore the software and system changes contemplated in this requirement can only be performed by the vendor which is currently providing operations and maintenance support to these particular IIS jurisdictions.

This notice is provided in accordance with FAR 5.203(a).
There is considerable evidence that the use of immunization information systems (IISs) can help to assess vaccination rates, inform public health interventions, and prevent vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).  IISs can enable public health officials to respond more efficiently to VPD outbreaks or other public health threats by quickly identifying geographic areas or populations that are not vaccinated, or who have not received all recommended vaccinations necessary to provide protection from one or more VDPs.  CDC has prioritized investments in advancing IISs and sees value in modernizing IISs to inform public health decisions. CDC demonstrates its commitment to advancing and modernizing IISs to improve the data quality by providing funding to support IISs under section 317b of the Public Health Service Act.  The Section 317 of the Public Health Services act provides the authority for CDC to issue the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) Immunization and Vaccine for Children (CDC-RFA-IP19-1901), to achieve section 317 priorities. CDC uses the Immunization Program Operations Manual (IPOM), a companion of the NOFO, to identify national IIS requirements and help jurisdictions prioritize their immunization management activities to meet them. In addition to the NOFO, CDC has started directly procuring services from IIS technology partners, in a limited capacity, to assist jurisdictions that use a common IIS technology platform to achieve select Section 317 NOFO IPOM requirements and national goals for IISs and immunization management.
The services contemplated under this requirement are part of CDC’s goals to modernize and optimize IISs to achieve Section 317 Public Health Services Act objectives.  Through this contract, CDC will  procure information technology services from BCBS of North Dakota in support of broader Section 317 IIS Information Technology (IT) infrastructure modernization priorities and that align to IPOM IIS requirements categories.  The scope of services for this acquisition encompasses the breadth of services and activities related advancing prioritized Section 317 IIS information management and infrastructure modernization efforts that improve the quality of IIS data. 
CDC intends to establish a sole source indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with each IIS technology partner. The Government is limited to using a sole source approach in order to align with the IIS technology partner each jurisdiction is already using for the support and operation of its IIS. In this way, the services procured under this portfolio of contracts will follow the existing IIS technology partner/jurisdiction relationship. To date, 52 out of the 64 state, territorial, and local IIS’s are operated and maintained by IIS technology partners. This requirement will be specifically for the following jurisdictions in which BCBS of North Dakota is currently an IIS technology partner:

Project Description and Requirements:
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotion of improvements in clinical and health systems practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that develops and presents evidence-based information on healthcare outcomes, quality, patient safety, cost, use and access. Included in AHRQ’s mandate is support of synthesis and dissemination of available scientific evidence, including dissemination research and analytic methods or systems for rating the strength of scientific evidence. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research on existing as well as innovating technologies, and conducts research on methods for measuring quality and strategies for improving quality. AHRQ also recognizes that a number of populations experience persistent disparities in health status, access to care, quality of care, and poor health outcomes.
AHRQ has a need for the development of evidence reviews (systematic review, technical brief/evidence map/scoping review, or topic brief) for the AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, which procures  high-quality evidence reviews and is a leader in developing evidence synthesis research methods.
The reviews must be consistent with established processes and guidance described in the AHRQ EPC Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews (https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/collections/cer-methods-guide). The methods and procedures are consistent with international guidance for reporting of systematic reviews, and adapted for AHRQ.
Systematic reviews are developed for an end-user, which may be a guideline development clinical group, Federal agency, healthcare provider, health system, payer, or research funder. The reviews vary in size, and often are large and complex, including 90-200+ studies. Reviews include public comment periods, peer review, and engagement of stakeholders. With funding from a variety of sources, each with a different program goal, the contractor will work with various partners and stakeholders to review a variety of health care delivery and clinical areas of focus.  Clinical areas may focus on traditional therapeutics as well as complementary, alternative, nutritional, and other emerging areas such as genomics and may span from preventative services to implementation of medical devices.
The service will be performed remotely. Each task order represents a single evidence review or reviews.
Anticipated period of performance:
The period of performance will vary for each topic and product purchased. Upcoming topics include:
1. Systematic Review of Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Mental Health in Children and Adolescents (Large topic refinement, with option of large systematic review, manuscript, webinar; 69 weeks)
2. Digestible Carbohydrate Intake and Maternal-Infant Outcomes (One medium systematic review; 53 weeks)
3. Fiber intake and Laxation outcomes (One large systematic review; 57 weeks)
Capability Information Sought:
Capabilities necessary to fulfill this requirement include:
Experience and expertise in evidence synthesis
Expertise in stakeholder engagement
Statistical expertise
Library science expertise
Project management experience
508-compliance experience
Editing experience
Content expertise in

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
Background:  The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Institute was authorized in 1974 (PL 93-296) to improve the health and well-being of older Americans through research. Specifically, NIA supports and conducts research on aging processes, aging-related diseases, and the special problems and needs of older people; trains highly skilled research scientists; develops and maintains state-of-the art resources to accelerate research progress; and communicates with the public about health and research advances. Subsequent amendments to this legislation designated NIA as the primary federal agency on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research. In January 2011, President Obama signed the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA), which called for an aggressive and coordinated national Alzheimer’s disease plan, which was unveiled in May 2012.
The NIA Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) plans and carries out a legislatively mandated education program to disseminate the research findings of the Institute and all other relevant information to help older Americans understand the aging process and live healthier lives. To assist in this outreach and communication effort, the NIA funds two national information centers: the National Institute on Aging Information Center (NIAIC) and the Alzheimer’s and related Dementias Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center, initiated in response to a 1986 Congressional mandate to “gather, maintain, and disseminate information about AD and publish an annual summary of the latest information” (P.L. 99 660, Part F, Section 951). In addition, the ADEAR Center’s activities contribute to the implementation of the National Plan instituted by NAPA. Together, these two centers form the NIA Information Resource Center. The need for the Centers has not diminished since their inception. In fact, as the American population ages, the need for research-based information on aging and AD and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) is ever more urgent.
In dealing with the public and other Information Center users, each of these two national information centers has a separate and unique identity. The NIAIC disseminates aging-related health education and disease prevention information, and the ADEAR Center serves as a national resource on AD/ADRD, providing accurate, timely, research-based information about dementia, its consequences and potential treatments, research, and available services. Each Information Center serves a broad audience of the general public, patients and family members, physicians and other health professionals, researchers, special interest groups, service organizations, other Government agencies, and the mass media.
Purpose and Objectives: To support NIA’s mission to disseminate information about health and research advances related to aging and Alzheimer’s disease, the Contractor shall provide information development and dissemination services including: website and database development, management, and maintenance; content and publications development and graphic design; public inquiry response; communications research; outreach; other communications support services; meeting and conference support; and warehousing/materials storage and distribution.

This notice is provided in accordance with FAR 5.203(a).
There is considerable evidence that the use of immunization information systems (IISs) can help to assess vaccination rates, inform public health interventions, and prevent vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).  IISs can enable public health officials to respond more efficiently to VPD outbreaks or other public health threats by quickly identifying geographic areas or populations that are not vaccinated, or who have not received all recommended vaccinations necessary to provide protection from one or more VDPs.  CDC has prioritized investments in advancing IISs and sees value in modernizing IISs to inform public health decisions. CDC demonstrates its commitment to advancing and modernizing IISs to improve the data quality by providing funding to support IISs under section 317b of the Public Health Service Act.  The Section 317 of the Public Health Services act provides the authority for CDC to issue the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) Immunization and Vaccine for Children (CDC-RFA-IP19-1901), to achieve section 317 priorities. CDC uses the Immunization Program Operations Manual (IPOM), a companion of the NOFO, to identify national IIS requirements and help jurisdictions prioritize their immunization management activities to meet them.   In addition to the NOFO, CDC has started directly procuring services from IIS technology partners, in a limited capacity, to assist jurisdictions that use a common IIS technology platform to achieve select Section 317 NOFO IPOM requirements and national goals for IISs and immunization management.
The services contemplated under this requirement are part of CDC’s goals to modernize and optimize IISs to achieve Section 317 Public Health Services Act objectives.  Through this contract, CDC will  procure information technology services from Envision in support of broader Section 317 IIS Information Technology (IT) infrastructure modernization priorities and that align to IPOM IIS requirements categories.  The scope of services for this acquisition encompasses the breadth of services and activities related advancing prioritized Section 317 IIS information management and infrastructure modernization efforts that improve the quality of IIS data. 
CDC intends to establish a sole source indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with each IIS technology partner. The Government is limited to using a sole source approach in order to align with the IIS technology partner each jurisdiction is already using for the support and operation of its IIS. In this way, the services procured under this portfolio of contracts will follow the existing IIS technology partner/jurisdiction relationship. To date, 52 out of the 64 state, territorial, and local IIS’s are operated and maintained by IIS technology partners. This requirement will be specifically for the following jurisdictions in which Envision is currently an IIS technology partner:

The Government will make an award to the responsible Quoter, whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Accordingly, since it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the highest technically rated Offeror, the Government will use a best value approach. The Government reserves the right not to make an award as a result of this solicitation, if in the opinion of the Government, none of the submissions would provide satisfactory performance at a cost that is considered fair and reasonable and/or economically feasible. Evaluations will be based solely on the materials included in the quote. Therefore, the Respondent's initial Quote should contain the best terms. After receipt of quotes, the Government will conduct an evaluation.

The Government anticipates selecting the best-suited quoter from initial responses, without engaging in exchanges with quoters.

Once the Government determines the quoter that is the best-suited (i.e., the apparent successful quoter), the Government reserves the right to communicate with only that quoter to address any remaining issues, if necessary, and finalize a purchase order with that quoter. These issues may include technical and price. If the parties cannot successfully address any remaining issues, as determined pertinent at the sole discretion of the Government, the Government reserves the right to communicate with the next best-suited quoter based on the original analysis and address any remaining issues. Once the Government has begun communications with the next best-suited quoter, no further communications with the previous quoter will be entertained until after the task order has been awarded. This process shall continue until an agreement is successfully reached and a purchase order is awarded.

This notice is provided in accordance with FAR 5.203(a).
There is considerable evidence that the use of immunization information systems (IISs) can help to assess vaccination rates, inform public health interventions, and prevent vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).  IISs can enable public health officials to respond more efficiently to VPD outbreaks or other public health threats by quickly identifying geographic areas or populations that are not vaccinated, or who have not received all recommended vaccinations necessary to provide protection from one or more VDPs.  CDC has prioritized investments in advancing IISs and sees value in modernizing IISs to inform public health decisions. CDC demonstrates its commitment to advancing and modernizing IISs to improve the data quality by providing funding to support IISs under section 317b of the Public Health Service Act.  The Section 317 of the Public Health Services act provides the authority for CDC to issue the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) Immunization and Vaccine for Children (CDC-RFA-IP19-1901), to achieve section 317 priorities. CDC uses the Immunization Program Operations Manual (IPOM), a companion of the NOFO, to identify national IIS requirements and help jurisdictions prioritize their immunization management activities to meet them. In addition to the NOFO, CDC has started directly procuring services from IIS technology partners, in a limited capacity, to assist jurisdictions that use a common IIS technology platform to achieve select Section 317 NOFO IPOM requirements and national goals for IISs and immunization management.
The services contemplated under this requirement are part of CDC’s goals to modernize and optimize IISs to achieve Section 317 Public Health Services Act objectives.  Through this contract, CDC will  procure information technology services from SSG in support of broader Section 317 IIS Information Technology (IT) infrastructure modernization priorities and that align to IPOM IIS requirements categories.  The scope of services for this acquisition encompasses the breadth of services and activities related advancing prioritized Section 317 IIS information management and infrastructure modernization efforts that improve the quality of IIS data. 
CDC intends to establish a sole source indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with each IIS technology partner. The Government is limited to using a sole source approach in order to align with the IIS technology partner each jurisdiction is already using for the support and operation of its IIS. In this way, the services procured under this portfolio of contracts will follow the existing IIS technology partner/jurisdiction relationship. To date, 52 out of the 64 state, territorial, and local IIS’s are operated and maintained by IIS technology partners. This requirement will be specifically for the following jurisdiction in which SSG is currently an IIS technology partner:
Massachusetts
The IDIQ contract contemplated for this requirement will be used to award task orders related to the  IPOM requirement categories below:
Data Quality and Visualization (aligns with IPOM strategy D1)
Interoperability and Date Exchange (aligns with IPOM strategy D2)
Clinical Services Best Practice in Immunization (aligns with IPOM strategy D2)
IIS Standardization, Certification, and Modernization (aligns with IPOM strategy D3)
Immunization Coverage/National Surveillance (aligns with IPOM strategy G4)
Outbreak /Pandemic Response (aligns with IPOM strategy G4)
The authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1, ""Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."" SSG is the only entity capable of performing these services for the jurisdictions for which it currently provides IIS services. This is due to the fact that it would be disruptive and inefficient to have two IIS vendors or system integrators providing the same type of operations, maintenance and enhancement services to a single IIS. To use two vendors would cause a duplication of costs and would violate software development best practices. Therefore the software and system changes contemplated in this requirement can only be performed by the vendor which is currently providing operations and maintenance support to these particular IIS jurisdictions.
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation to David Mourar, Contract Specialist, at jwc4@cdc.gov, which shall be considered by the agency. The deadline for submissions is October 13, 2023, at 4:30pm Eastern time.

The authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1, ""Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."" Deloitte Consulting is the only entity capable of performing these services for the jurisdictions for which it currently provides IIS services. This is due to the fact that it would be disruptive and inefficient to have two IIS vendors or system integrators providing the same type of operations, maintenance and enhancement services to a single IIS. To use two vendors would cause a duplication of costs and would violate software development best practices. Therefore the software and system changes contemplated in this requirement can only be performed by the vendor which is currently providing operations and maintenance support to these particular IIS jurisdictions.
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation to David Mourar, Contract Specialist, at jwc4@cdc.gov, which shall be considered by the agency. The deadline for submissions is October 13, 2023, at 4:30pm Eastern time.
The Government will review any/all information submitted to determine if other responsible sources exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.",2,Positive,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract with Deloitte Consulting LLP, 1919 N.

CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION
The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. As multiple researchers utilize imaging techniques involving glass microscope slides, it is important that the Radiology Department procure a slide etching system for efficient data management and storage. The ink used in the printing system is directly printed onto the glass itself and is solvent resistant. There is no glare associated with the end-product as the etching does not involve a sticker label; downstream applications are optimized for overview imaging. The SlideMate has a uniquely small physical footprint which is critical as laboratory space is at a premium in LDRR. Additionally, the vertical design of the equipment allows slide printing in restricted areas, such as directly next to a cryostat or in the MicroPET imaging suite.
In accordance with FAR part 10, extensive market research was conducted to reach this determination. Additionally, knowledgeable individuals in the Government and Industry were contacted for market research purposes. None of the subject matter experts contacted were able to identify any contractor. Finally, a review of both the GSA Advantage and Dynamic Small Business Search returned no results.
APPLICABLE CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS
The provision at FAR clause 52.212 and other HHSAR and NIH clauses are applicable. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is not applicable to this requirement.

CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION
The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. This is a SDVOSB sole source.  Alliant is the authorized distributor of Olympus products.  These systems and software integrations are part of many patient enrolled protocols at NIH for nearly two decades. The Clinical Center's Procedure, Vascular Access, Conscious Sedation (PVCS) provide endoscopic procedures for both clinical and research criteria for patients enrolled in protocols at NIH. The ENT Clinic's Head and Neck (H&N) physicians need to view and capture high definition images during patient exams. The CC needs to upgrade to the newest technology, Excera 190 processor, to meet our current supply of HD scopes, by replacing our Olympus Series 180 with the Series 190 System. The Series 190 System is a replacement of equipment only and will still interface with current CC flexible and rigid scopes, system application and electronic medical record. Our current video equipment is beyond their estimated useful lives as defined by the American Hospital Association (AHA) and current technology.
In accordance with FAR part 10, extensive market research was conducted to reach this determination. Additionally, knowledgeable individuals in the Government and Industry were contacted for market research purposes. None of the subject matter experts contacted were able to identify any contractor.

Pre-solicitation Notice Information
Introduction
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was established to conduct and support research to better understand the causes of allergic, immunologic, and infectious diseases, and to develop better means of presenting, diagnosing, and treating illness. In support of this mission, NIAID executes a Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research and Research Agenda for Emerging Infectious Disease. Much of this research depends on the study of laboratory animals. Proper management of the NIAID program of animal care and use is essential for the welfare of the animals, validity of research data, and the health and safety of the animal care staff.
The NIAID currently maintains animal facilities in seven (7) buildings on the Bethesda and Twinbrook campuses in Maryland (MD), five (5) buildings on the Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) Campus in Hamilton, Montana (MT), and maintains a research section in one (1) building on the Division of Veterinary Resources (DVR) operated NIH Animal Center (NIHAC) campus in Poolesville, MD. The NIAID is responsible for the operation of an NIH shared animal facility used by NIAID along with several other NIH Institutes (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Human Genome Research Institute; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; and National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases). The Scientific Directors of these Institutes have delegated through Intra-Agency Agreements (IAAs), the responsibility and authority for care of animals that are housed in the NIH shared animal facility to the Scientific Director of the NIAID. The NIAID also maintains animals in the NIH central animal facility. All of the NIAID care and use of animals is conducted in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines in order to maintain accreditation by the Association for Assessment and accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALACI).
The NIAID experimental animals must be maintained under carefully controlled conditions to minimize research variables and allow the accurate interpretation of laboratory result. Consequently, it is essential that animal colonies be consistently and properly maintained to avoid any situation or condition such as undue stress, disease, animal misidentification, animal escape, etc., the might adversely affect experiments. The proper care of these animals is integral to the research performed at NIH.
The current contract with Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Contract No. HHSN272201800014C, will expire on March 13, 2024.
Description
The purpose of this contract is to care for animals at NIH’s research facilities in ABSL1-ABSL4 environments and support the facility and the work being performed therein.
Contract support shall be provided on-site at locations that house NIAID research animals to include the NIH main campus in Bethesda MD, off-campus owned/leased facilities in Rockville MD, the NIH Animal Center (NIHAC) in Poolesville MD and the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton MT.  New NIH/NIAID installations that are not designated at the time of contract award shall be so served upon the request of the Contracting Officer and accomplished by a modification of the contract.
The Contractor shall provide a wide range of professional, technical and support services to the DIR Animal Care Program required for the proper care, use and humane treatment of laboratory animals, and to provide a wide range of technical skills required for the scientific study and manipulation of animals and animal projects.

A. Contractor should have experience as stated in Attachment A, B, C: Statement of Work in a private practice and/or hospital for at least the minimum years in the specialty of their field (see Attachment A, B, C: Statement of Work for minimum years). The lack of experience at an Indian Health Service, Service Unit should not discourage a potential Contractor from submitting an offer. Past performance evaluation will consider reliability of past performance information, source of information, and the relevance of information. Offerors without relevant past performance or for whom past performance information is not available, will receive a neutral rating. 
B. Offeror shall submit at least two or more similar or same scope of contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of quality of work, compliance with performance schedules, provision of qualified persons to client both at time of award and to replacement of Contractor persons. In addition PPIRS and FAPIIS data may be used for evaluations. 
The following adjectival rating system will be used by the Government to determine the overall past performance rating of each proposal:
Past Performance Rating    
Rating    Description
Very Low Risk    Offer's past performance record provides essentially no doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Low Risk    Offer's past performance record provides little doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Moderate Risk    Offer's past performance record, although satisfactory, provides some doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
High Risk    Offeror's past performance record provides substantial doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Neutral/Unknown Risk    The offer has no relevant past performance record. A thorough search was unable to identify any past performance information.
PRICE: 
Cost/price will be evaluated for reasonableness. The price must represent what a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. An award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value to the Government.
The price proposal shall be specific, complete in every detail, and separate from the technical proposal.  The price proposal shall be submitted on enclosed pages of Price Schedule, Schedule of Supplies/Service and shall contain all information relative to cost and pricing. (Also submit pricing information as indicated in Attachment F Price Schedule). 
The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if a later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. The Government may exercise its right to award without discussions.

Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. (Leidos Biomed), a subsidiary of Leidos Corporation, a Delaware corporation with offices in Frederick, MD is the Operations and Technical Support (OTS) contractor for the National Cancer Institute at Frederick.  The effort to be performed will be part of Leidos Biomed’s Prime Contract 75N91019D00024 that has been issued by the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD.
Description of Work - National Cancer Institute’s Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) is the largest public repository of comprehensive tumor proteomic datasets. It’s a cloud-based resource that collects, harmonizes, and hosts mass spectrometry-based proteomic data along with corresponding metadata across a variety of tumor types from programs including Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC) and the Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) network. The PDC data portal is open access and provides end users with appropriate compute capacity to support large-scale analytical capabilities. PDC also maps datasets, when available, to corresponding genomic and/or imaging data within the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC).
Objectives - The objectives of Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) are (1) to make cancer-related proteomic datasets easily accessible to the public, and (2) to facilitate direct multi-omics integration in support of precision medicine through interoperability with accompanying data resources (such as genomic and medical image datasets). The scope of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to operate, maintain and improve the existing Proteomic Data Commons (PDC). The PDC has been available to the scientific community for over 3 years. It is part of the CRDC data ecosystem and is expected to utilize all the relevant CRDC interoperability requirements such as Cancer Data Aggregator. Areas influenced by these requirements include system design, PDC data model, data sharing, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and communication activities. Since the PDC has already completed development and has been released in a production environment, the main activities will be continued operations of PDC along with necessary enhancements due to the new data types (such as metabolomics) and to improve data utilization and interoperability.",3,Positive,"This Special Notice has been released to notify Offerors of an Amendment to Solicitation S23-072.

(ix)         The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (November 2021), applies to this acquisition.   
Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, price and past performance are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.
The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in herein. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirement as set forth herein. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors set forth above.
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) minimum specifications of the technical, performance, and functional characteristics of the proposed product; (2) technical support, customer support and delivery, installation, and set-up plan; (3) warranty and preventative maintenance agreement plan; (4) Past Performance; and (5) Price.
Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, price and past performance are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.
The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in herein. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirement as set forth herein. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors set forth above.
The evaluation factors are used when reviewing the proposals: (1) Technical Capability and Functionality—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for overall capability and functionality in relation to the General Requirement, Salient Characteristics, Quantity and Deliverables as described in the Purchase Description; (2) Contract Management and Customer Support—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s ability to provide a high level of customer service, particularly in the area of initial responsiveness and resolution of device and service problems; (3) Speed of Delivery, Installation and Set-up—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for completeness, feasibility, soundness and practicality of the proposed approach and work plan for accomplishing the requirements of the statement of work; (4) Past Performance—Offerors will be evaluated based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. Furthermore, the Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information; and (5) Price— Offerors price quote will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques. Price evaluation will not be conducted on any Offeror determined to be technically unacceptable.
Offerors may respond with a proposal indicating their ability to provide the technical specifications stated in this solicitation. Responses will be evaluated based on the contractor’s ability to meet the Government’s requirements.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in herein. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirement as set forth herein. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors set forth above.
The evaluation factors are used when reviewing the proposals: (1) Technical Capability and Functionality—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for overall capability and functionality in relation to the General Requirement, Salient Characteristics, Quantity and Deliverables as described in the Purchase Description; (2) Contract Management and Customer Support—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s ability to provide a high level of customer service, particularly in the area of initial responsiveness and resolution of device and service problems; (3) Speed of Delivery, Installation and Set-up—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for completeness, feasibility, soundness and practicality of the proposed approach and work plan for accomplishing the requirements of the statement of work; (4) Past Performance—Offerors will be evaluated based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. Furthermore, the Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information; and (5) Price— Offerors price quote will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market.

i.      This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

A fixed-price type of purchase order is contemplated for this requirement.
The solicitation number is 75N95023Q00614 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) as a total small business set-aside.
(iii)         The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2023-05 / 09-07-2023.
(iv)         The associated NAICS code 541690 – Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services and the small business size standard $9.0 M.   This requirement is a total small business set-aside.
(v)          National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS), Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Section (MPBS) requires the services of a contractor to obtain camelid animal husbandry, injection, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) / ribonucleic acid (RNA) harvesting service for nanobody generation.
(vi)         STATEMENT OF WORK (SERVICES) (SOW)
Background Information and Objective: Nanobody is a single-domain antibody that are found only in a few species of animal such as the camelids (alpaca, llama, camels for example).  Like whole antibodies, nanobody is capable of binding selectively to a specific antigen and sometimes with even more robust affinity.  Due to their smaller size, they are easier to isolate, and mass produced in bulk.
The NINDS MPBS Laboratory require nanobodies generated against two-ion channel proteins of interest.  These nanobodies would be used for stabilizing the proteins for structural studies. MPBS would also test if some of the nanobodies could affect the functions of these proteins using functional studies and in the long term to pull down complexes from native tissues to study protein-protein interactions.
Commercially available antibodies against these two-ion channel proteins have been purchased and tested.  As seen from all literature searched and data reported so far, none of the commercially available antibodies show robust or good enough binding capacity to our two proteins of interest. 
Therefore, MPBS will attempt to generate nanobodies from camelids which have been widely reported in literature as having more robust affinity.
The vendor/contractor with a USDA and NIH approved camelid farm (with assurance numbers provided) that can immunize the animal (one alpaca and one llama) for nanobody generation is required for this project. 
All veterinary care, injections and husbandry and blood collection will be performed by the vendor/contractor.  MPBS will be provided with the pre- and post-immunized serum. From the final serum, the vendor/contractor will perform the RNA extraction from PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells).  After such time, MPBS will be provided with RNA to generate cDNA from the RNA samples for constructing a phage display library and searching for nanobodies that have robust binding to the two ion channel proteins of interest.
General Requirements: Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the Statement of Work below:
Specific Requirements: The vendor/contractor shall provide all husbandry, animal housing, veterinary care, blood/serum collection, PBMC isolation and RNA isolation from one alpaca and one llama for the purpose of nanobody generation.  This includes 5 immunizations, 1 pre-immune bleed (~10ml serum), 1 test bleed (~10ml serum), 2 production bleeds (500ml whole blood), total IgG serum titer ELISA testing of all bleeds, IgG 2_3 serum titer ELISA testing of final bleed.  For PBMC isolation, 2 production bleeds (> 1x107 cells/each production bleeds) are required and then preservation of PBMC cells for RNA purification.
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES: Government will provide initial purified protein samples for immunization into one alpaca and one llama.  No other samples or reagent shall be required or submitted by the government.
DELIVERY OR DELIVERABLES: Government should receive all blood/serum collected and PBMC and RNA purified at the end of the project.
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: Vendor/contractor is not required to report to government with any written progress unless animal health is affected.  In the event that an animal becomes ill/sick due to immunization, vendor should notify government in writing and adhere to all USDA and NIH specified governing laws for animal handling and veterinary care.
(vii)        The period of performance is four (4) to six (6) months. September 2023 through March 2024. Delivery shall be made Thirty (30) to sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the order. Delivery shall be made to the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS), Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Section (MPBS).   
(viii)       The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items (September 2023), is applicable to this solicitation.
(ix)         The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (November 2021), applies to this acquisition.
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The total points possible is 100.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Technical Capability: Points Possible: fifty (50); Narrative: The offeror shall detail in a technical proposal the processes and methods it will use for completion of the project requirements as well as the qualifications of the contractor employees to perform this work; (2) Timeliness and Delivery: Points Possible: Twenty-Five (25); Narrative: The offeror shall detail in a technical proposal how it shall meet the delivery timeframe and method requirements. The Government shall evaluate the offeror’s ability to meet or exceed the requirements detailed in this statement of work; (3) Past Performance: Points Possible: Twenty-Five (25); Narrative: The offeror must have prior experience in the manufacture of Nanobody Generation from Camelids; and (4) Cost/Price: Cost not a rated factor.
Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, price and past performance are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.
The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in herein. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirement as set forth herein. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors set forth above.
The evaluation factors are used when reviewing the proposals: (1) Technical Capability and Functionality—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for overall capability and functionality in relation to the General Requirement, Salient Characteristics, Quantity and Deliverables as described in the Purchase Description; (2) Contract Management and Customer Support—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s ability to provide a high level of customer service, particularly in the area of initial responsiveness and resolution of device and service problems; (3) Speed of Delivery, Installation and Set-up—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for completeness, feasibility, soundness and practicality of the proposed approach and work plan for accomplishing the requirements of the statement of work; (4) Past Performance—Offerors will be evaluated based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. Furthermore, the Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information; and (5) Price— Offerors price quote will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques. Price evaluation will not be conducted on any Offeror determined to be technically unacceptable.
Offerors may respond with a proposal indicating their ability to provide the technical specifications stated in this solicitation. Responses will be evaluated based on the contractor’s ability to meet the Government’s requirements.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

viii.  The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items (September 2023), is applicable to this solicitation.
ix.  The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (November 2021), applies to this acquisition.
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) minimum specifications of the technical, performance, and functional characteristics of the proposed product; (2) technical support, customer support and delivery, installation, and set-up plan; (3) warranty and preventative maintenance agreement plan; (4) Past Performance; and (5) Price.
Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, price and past performance are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.
The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in herein. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirement as set forth herein. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors set forth above.
The evaluation factors are used when reviewing the proposals: (1) Technical Capability and Functionality—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for overall capability and functionality in relation to the General Requirement, Salient Characteristics, Quantity and Deliverables as described in the Purchase Description; (2) Contract Management and Customer Support—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s ability to provide a high level of customer service, particularly in the area of initial responsiveness and resolution of device and service problems; (3) Speed of Delivery, Installation and Set-up—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for completeness, feasibility, soundness and practicality of the proposed approach and work plan for accomplishing the requirements of the statement of work; (4) Past Performance—Offerors will be evaluated based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. Furthermore, the Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information; and (5) Price— Offerors price quote will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques. Price evaluation will not be conducted on any Offeror determined to be technically unacceptable.
Offerors may respond with a proposal indicating their ability to provide the technical specifications stated in this solicitation. Responses will be evaluated based on the contractor’s ability to meet the Government’s requirements.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of AIDS has a requirement for the operation of the Virology Core Laboratory.  The current Virology Core Laboratory (VCL) is held by Duke University (HHSN272201800003C).
Description
The primary purpose of the VCL is to quantitatively measure viral RNA levels in samples in support of a candidate AIDS vaccine (or other intervention) being tested.  The VCL will also produce a large volume of at least 500ml, well characterized SIV, SHIV, and/or HIV viral stocks that will serve as standard reagents for the scientific community.    Assays may be performed on fresh and/or frozen preclinical samples.  All assays undergo testing for inter- and intra-assay as well as inter- and intra-operator variability.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are developed for all assays, laboratory processes, and equipment use and maintenance.   Additionally, all work done by the VCL is conducted under good laboratory practice (GLP)-like standards, thereby ensuring rigor and reproducibility.  For the purposes of this contract, GLP-like standards are defined as the application of the principles of Good Laboratory Practices Regulation, codified in CFR Title 21 Part 58, but not requiring external accreditation or official Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review of the laboratory. 
The Contractor shall develop, acquire, optimize, and conduct assays to characterize and quantitatively determine the level of SIV, SHIV, or HIV viral RNA in samples such as plasma, mucosal tissues or secretions, lymphoid tissues, or other tissues derived from animals infected with SIV, SHIV, or HIV and in samples from in vitro virus cultures and virus stocks.  In vivo studies are anticipated to largely include NHP animal studies but may extend to small animal models including mouse models or others as directed by the COR.  Assays to detect viral RNA for other infectious agents may be requested.
The Contractor shall use current state-of-the-art technologies to conduct quantitative and high-throughput viral RNA assays, shall incorporate new and optimized technologies for assay development into contract activities when appropriate, and shall conduct other activities to accomplish the technical objectives of the statement of work (e.g. virus stock production).  Assays shall incorporate appropriate positive and negative controls using reference panels to define background and dynamic range and shall demonstrate reproducibility and consistency.
Specifically, the Contractor shall: 1) conduct validated viral assays using GLP-like processes; 2) receive, store, catalog, track, and maintain an inventory of the samples for evaluation; 3) analyze, manage, report, and deposit assay data; 4) perform project management activities related to contract activities; 5) conduct initial and final transition activities, as needed; and 6) perform Option work described below, if required.
It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded.  The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one year Options (terms that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally), for a total possible performance period of 7 years, beginning on or about November 15, 2024.  The performance requirement will be the delivery of 3.0 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and Option periods 1-6 (Year 2 through Year 7).  Please note that the number of FTEs is exclusive of subcontractor and consultant effort. 
In addition, the Government may exercise Options to accommodate unanticipated increases in demand as follows:
Options 7 through 13: Increased Level of Effort:  The Government may exercise Options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of the contract. Should the Government elect to exercise these Options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 0.5 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) for each Option exercised.  These Options may be exercised once per year during Years 1 through 7.  The period of performance of an Option for increased level of effort for this purpose will not exceed the term of the Base Period or Option year in which the Option is exercised.  Please note that the number of FTEs is exclusive of subcontractor and consultant effort. 
Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 7, 2023, and may be accessed through SAM.gov. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

I.  PURPOSE
The World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program requests information on methods for establishing a research cohort of sufficient size to conduct future studies on the health and educational impacts of 9/11 exposures on persons aged 21 years or younger at the time of exposure to the terrorist attacks and aftermath, including such individuals who are screening-eligible WTC survivors or certified-eligible WTC survivors. The cohort and its members are hereafter referred to as the “Youth Cohort” and “WTC Youth,” respectively. The Youth Cohort must:
Be of sufficient size to conduct future research studies on the health and educational impacts of 9/11 exposures;
Include sufficient representation of individuals who were 21 years of age or younger at the time of exposure; and
Include individuals who are screening-eligible WTC survivors or certified-eligible WTC survivors.
The cohort can also include individuals 21 or younger on September 11, 2001, who were located outside the New York City Disaster Area (NYCDA) and in Manhattan up to 14th Street; or anywhere within the borough of Brooklyn. Additionally, the cohort can include age-appropriate control populations as needed for research purposes
II.  BACKGROUND  
In Jan. of 2011, the President signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act (“Zadroga Act”) into law, with Title I amending the Public Health Service Act to establish the WTC Health Prgoram. The WTC Health Program is a limited federal health program administered by NIOSH, part of CDC, that provides no-cost medical monitoring and treatment for certified WTC-related health conditions to those directly affected by the 9/11 attacks in New York, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA. The Program also funds medical research into physical and mental health conditions related to 9/11 exposures. 
In Dec. of 2022, the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2023, further amended the Public Health Service Act by directing NIOSH to establish a research cohort of sufficient size to conduct future research studies on the health and educational impacts of 9/11 exposures on persons aged 21 years or younger at the time of exposure, including such individuals who are screening-eligible WTC survivors or certified-eligible WTC survivors. “Survivors” are considered to be those individuals in the dust or dust cloud in the NYCDA on September 11, 2001; or worked, lived, or attended school, childcare, or adult daycare in the NYCDA for certain timeframes on and or shortly after 9/11.
III.  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
In 2020, the WTC Health Registry within the New York City (NYC) Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), in collaboration with the NYC Dept. of Education (DOE), published findings from a youth research cohort feasibility study that examined WTC Youth recruitment methods using public school directory information. The directory information contains key elements on children who were enrolled in NYC public schools K–12 that are needed for tracing. The concept included persons who were too young to be in school on 9/11 and were first enrolled through the 2006­–2007 school year. These data may be available for future tracing; however, additional strategies will be necessary to recruit persons attending private schools or home schooled, and those not otherwise traceable using the directory information. These strategies may include media campaigns and interaction with community groups to encourage enrollment.
Power calculations in support of the DOHMH feasibility study found that approximately 7,000 persons (equal exposed and unexposed groups) were needed to achieve 80% statistical power for a longitudinal study of coronary heart disease associated with dichotomous exposure, accounting for age stratification. This sample size is used in this RFI.
This RFI assumes that the cohort will be restricted to persons who were 21 years of age or younger on September 11, 2001, and who fall within one of 3 categories of exposure:
The “high” exposed group, comprised of persons inside the NYCDA who are either screening-eligible WTC survivors or certified-eligible WTC survivors;
The “low” exposed group, comprising of persons outside the NYCDA and in Manhattan not further north than 14th Street; or Brooklyn; and
An “unexposed” group that comprise an appropriate control group for statistical comparisons.  
IV.  INFORMATION REQUESTED
This RFI requests comments and relevant, evidence-based information addressing the following areas:
1. Best-practices and preferred approaches for assembling a cohort of at least 7,000 individuals with sufficient representation of individuals who were 21 years of age or younger at the time of World Trade Center exposure. Strategies should be designed to achieve the following:
An efficient cohort design that addresses the preferred characteristics for each of the 3 exposure groups listed.
Identification of the best methods to utilize the DOE student directory data for assembly of the youth cohort. The DOE student directory data is a core source of information on children enrolled in NYC public schools K–12 at the time of 9/11.
Recruitment strategies that are implemented without the use of the DOE student directory, such as methods necessary for persons enrolled in private schools, home schooled or not attending school (e.g., graduates less than age 21 years on 9/11).
Identification of health conditions and potentially adverse educational impacts that are priorities for future WTC Youth research.
Best practices required for data collection, storage, dissemination, and quality assurance.
Best practices for the creation and delivery of clear, timely, accurate, detailed, and thorough progress reports
2. Methods to develop, coordinate, and manage outreach and education strategies and activities designed to identify and engage young adult survivors. Strategies should be designed to achieve the following:
Establishment of a group of young adult survivors to advise and assist with the planning and implementation of outreach and education activities and initiatives required for cohort development.
Identification of the best methods to communicate the positive reason(s) for young adult survivors to participate in the WTC Health Program’s research component to help advance knowledge about 9/11-related environmental exposures.
Identification of the most effective methods of ongoing communication.
3. Description of any relevant organizational experience and expertise.

Purpose and Objectives: The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Section on Social and Cognitive Developmental Neuroscience (SSCDN), requires the purchase of a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) system to capture whole brain activity across the lifespan from infancy to adulthood.
Background:  An EEG system is needed to be used to collect electrical activity of the brain.  As a new section at NIMH new equipment is needed for data collection. The Electrical Geodesics, Inc’s (EGI) EEG system came as a recommendation from other labs at the NIH and coincide nicely with imaging tools in the Clinical Center to encourage future collaborations. The EEG system from Electrical Geodesics Inc. (EGI) captures whole brain activity, and supports fast and easy application, which is a top priority when working for challenging populations, such as our research population (children with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis). Additionally, the EEG nets are compatible with fMRI, TMS, MEG, TES, which may be of interest for future studies in the Section on Social and Cognitive Developmental Neuroscience.
Project requirements: The EEG system required for this project is based upon the technology of Electrical Geodesic’s EEG Systems.  Specifically, the EEG system must include: (1) Whole head coverage — evenly spaced sensors provide full scalp coverage for the highest spatial resolution data — choose from 32, 64, 128, or 256 channels; (2) Expandability — the GES products are designed to grow with your lab — you can start small and add increased channel counts or additional functionalities as your needs change; (3) Integrated EEG Analysis Software — EGI’s updated Net Station software is fully integrated to optimize data analysis, data review, and data acquisition; (4) Multimodal imaging capability — with upgrade modules, the GES 400 product can be used in MR or MEG environments, and GES 400 and 405 products are compatible with EEG-TMS; (5) On-site installation; (6) On-site Training; (7) Basic Contract Support; and (8) 1-year manufacturers warranty and up to 3-years of extended warranty periods.
Anticipated period of performance: Three (3), Twelve (12) Month Option Periods for extended warranty coverage to commence after the expiration of the manufacturer’s warranty period.

Purpose and Objectives:
National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS), Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Section (MPBS) requires the services of a contractor to obtain camelid animal husbandry, injection, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) / ribonucleic acid (RNA) harvesting service for nanobody generation.
Background: 
Nanobody is a single-domain antibody that are found only in a few species of animal such as the camelids (alpaca, llama, camels for example).  Like whole antibodies, nanobody is capable of binding selectively to a specific antigen and sometimes with even more robust affinity.  Due to their smaller size, they are easier to isolate, and mass produced in bulk.
The NINDS MPBS Laboratory require nanobodies generated against two-ion channel proteins of interest.  These nanobodies would be used for stabilizing the proteins for structural studies. MPBS would also test if some of the nanobodies could affect the functions of these proteins using functional studies and in the long term to pull down complexes from native tissues to study protein-protein interactions.
Commercially available antibodies against these two-ion channel proteins have been purchased and tested.  As seen from all literature searched and data reported so far, none of the commercially available antibodies show robust or good enough binding capacity to our two proteins of interest. 
Therefore, MPBS will attempt to generate nanobodies from camelids which have been widely reported in literature as having more robust affinity.
The vendor/contractor with a USDA and NIH approved camelid farm (with assurance numbers provided) that can immunize the animal (one alpaca and one llama) for nanobody generation is required for this project. 
All veterinary care, injections and husbandry and blood collection will be performed by the vendor/contractor.  MPBS will be  provided with the pre- and post-immunized serum.   From the final serum, the vendor/contractor will perform the  RNA extraction from PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells).  After such time, MPBS will be provided with RNA to generate cDNA from the RNA samples for constructing a phage display library and searching for nanobodies that have robust binding to the two ion channel proteins of interest.
Project requirements:
The vendor/contractor shall provide all husbandry, animal housing, veterinary care, blood/serum collection, PBMC isolation and RNA isolation from one alpaca and one llama for the purpose of nanobody generation.  This includes 5 immunizations, 1 pre-immune bleed (~10ml serum), 1 test bleed (~10ml serum), 2 production bleeds (500ml whole blood), total IgG serum titer ELISA testing of all bleeds, IgG 2_3 serum titer ELISA testing of final bleed.  For PBMC isolation, 2 production bleeds (> 1x107 cells/each production bleeds) are required and then preservation of PBMC cells for RNA purification.
Anticipated period of performance: Four (4) to Six (6) months. September 2023 through March 2024.
Other important considerations: In case domestic sources are available and capable of fulfilling the Government’s need, and a future solicitation is published, the Government will use evaluation preferences in accordance with FAR 25.

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement, to determine the method of acquisition, and availability of domestic sources manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. Small businesses are encouraged to respond.
For equipment/supply requirements, responses must include the place of manufacturing (i.e. address if supply/equipment is a domestic end product and include country of manufacture). For equipment/supply requirements, small businesses must also address the size status of the manufacturer under the applicable NAICS code (i.e. address Non-Manufacturer Rule).
Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire an Echo Revolve R4 microscope for dual use as an upright and inverted fluorescence microscope for imaging mouse brain slices. The Echo Revolve R4 Microscope is manufactured by Discover Echo, Inc., 9530 Padgett Street, Suite 101, San Diego CA 92126.  This equipment will be critical for the central mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Integrative Neuroscience Section (INS) to study the neural basis of normal and disordered learning and memory processes.
This item will expand NINDS INS laboratory capacity to perform fluorescence imaging of mouse brain slice tissue across a broad range of wavelengths and in two optical configurations: upright and inverted. The NINDS INS laboratory has needs for the optical imaging uniquely afforded by both of these configurations. The Echo Revolve system allows for the easy conversion between these configurations without the need for two separate microscopes. This item is only available through Discover Echo, Inc. and is the sole designer and manufacturer of the Revolve microscope and its dedicated software user interface. The NINDS INS laboratory require this particular microscope, with its exclusive combination of features and configurations, to allow for our dual needs of an integrated upright and inverted fluorescence microscope in a single, small-footprint, user-friendly platform.
Background:  Research in the INS probes the neural circuit basis of normal working memory and characterizes the neural circuit and working memory dysfunction in mouse models of genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia and related disorders. INS members use optical sensors and actuators to record and manipulate the function of discrete cells and circuits in freely moving mice. INS focuses on understanding the neural computations within, and circuit-level interactions between, the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of the mouse. All such experiments require post-experiment verification and quantification of the expression of these optical sensors and actuators, each tagged with a fluorescent  molecule, in mouse brain slices. The ability to efficiently conduct mouse brain slice fluorescence imaging of genetically expressed indicators and manipulators of neural activity with upright and inverted scope technology is required for the research conducted in the INS.
Project requirements: Summarize the potential requirement or proposed acquisition, including its scope, focus, technical/performance requirements or specifications, and any deliverables, reports, and/or data that may be required under any resultant contract. Highlight any areas of particular importance.

Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire an Echo Revolve R4 microscope for dual use as an upright and inverted fluorescence microscope for imaging mouse brain slices. The Echo Revolve R4 Microscope is manufactured by Discover Echo, Inc., 9530 Padgett Street, Suite 101, San Diego CA 92126.  This equipment will be critical for the central mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Integrative Neuroscience Section (INS) to study the neural basis of normal and disordered learning and memory processes.
This item will expand NINDS INS laboratory capacity to perform fluorescence imaging of mouse brain slice tissue across a broad range of wavelengths and in two optical configurations: upright and inverted. The NINDS INS laboratory has needs for the optical imaging uniquely afforded by both of these configurations. The Echo Revolve system allows for the easy conversion between these configurations without the need for two separate microscopes. This item is only available through Discover Echo, Inc. and is the sole designer and manufacturer of the Revolve microscope and its dedicated software user interface. The NINDS INS laboratory require this particular microscope, with its exclusive combination of features and configurations, to allow for our dual needs of an integrated upright and inverted fluorescence microscope in a single, small-footprint, user-friendly platform.
Background:  Research in the INS probes the neural circuit basis of normal working memory and characterizes the neural circuit and working memory dysfunction in mouse models of genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia and related disorders. INS members use optical sensors and actuators to record and manipulate the function of discrete cells and circuits in freely moving mice. INS focuses on understanding the neural computations within, and circuit-level interactions between, the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of the mouse. All such experiments require post-experiment verification and quantification of the expression of these optical sensors and actuators, each tagged with a fluorescent  molecule, in mouse brain slices. The ability to efficiently conduct mouse brain slice fluorescence imaging of genetically expressed indicators and manipulators of neural activity with upright and inverted scope technology is required for the research conducted in the INS.
Project requirements: Summarize the potential requirement or proposed acquisition, including its scope, focus, technical/performance requirements or specifications, and any deliverables, reports, and/or data that may be required under any resultant contract. Highlight any areas of particular importance.
Minimum Performance Functional Characteristics:
Easily convert from upright to inverted configurations.

CDC0.H049 Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor and Contractor Employees (Jun 2020)
a. The contractor and contractor employees shall prepare and submit Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) to the Contracting Officer prior to access of government information or the commencement of work at CDC. *See Attachments*
b. The NDAs, at Exhibit I and II, are required in service contracts where contractor’s employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information while performing functions in support of the Government. The NDA also requires contractor’s employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities, and members of the public (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor’s work with the CDC). The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states “All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed.”
c. The contractor shall inform contractor employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the identification requirements.
d. During the contract performance period, the contractor is responsible to ensure that all additional or replacement contractors’ employees sign an NDA and it is submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of their work with the CDC.
e. Contractor employees in designated positions or functions that have not signed the appropriate NDA shall not have access to any non-public, procurement sensitive information or participate in government meetings where sensitive information may be discussed.
f. The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a current list of employees working under NDAs and submit to the Contracting Officer upon request during the contract period of performance. The list should at a minimum include: contract number, employee’s name, position, date of hire and NDA requirement.",-1,Negative,"This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Overview:
The All of Us Research Program, within the Office of the Director (OD) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has issued a research opportunity announcement to solicit white papers supporting various Areas of Interest (AOIs). A ROA is a method of solicitation that announces the anticipated availability of Other Transactions (OT) awards, a special type of legal instrument other than contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.
Purpose:
The All of Us Research Program is a historic effort to gather data from at least 1 million people, with the goal of accelerating health research and medical breakthroughs, and enabling individualized prevention, treatment, and care. The program is creating a national research resource to inform thousands of studies, covering a wide variety of health conditions. Researchers will use data from the program to learn more about how individual differences in lifestyle, environment, and biological makeup can influence health and disease.
The purpose of this announcement is to fund organizations who can help All of Us build its cohort of volunteers who reflect the rich diversity of the United States and are actively engaged as partners. These funded organizations will help design and implement strategies to raise awareness of the program through community and health care provider organizations, drive increased enrollment of participants, foster regular communication with participants, and engage the research community to use the data being gathered.
Award Project Duration: Award periods are anticipated to be up to five (5) years but may be shortened or extended as needed.
White Paper Deadlines: This ROA will remain open for three (3) years from its issue date, unless otherwise updated via an amendment, and includes multiple white paper (WP) submission deadlines. All WP deadline times are 3:00 PM Eastern Time:

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requested.
Market Research is being performed pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to identify businesses capable of performing the functions described herein.
The government is seeking firms under the North America Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building construction with an annual size standard of $45.5M.
In accordance with Disclosure of the Magnitude of Construction Projects, the anticipated project magnitude is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.
Description/Scope of Work:
The Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Health Service (IHS) anticipates a design-build acquisition for the Alamo Replacement Health Center project located along New Mexico State Highway 169 (SR 169) in the Alamo Navajo Indian Reservation, Socorro County, New Mexico. TERO is applicable.
The Contractor shall design and construct a new Indian Health Service Health Center to serve as a comprehensive outpatient wellness facility to service the Alamo Band of Navajo community and other eligible beneficiaries.  The facility cannot exceed 70,000-square-foot, and is envisioned as having a substantial two-story section.  It is part of the Albuquerque Area Service Unit located approximately 25 miles NNW of Magdalena, New Mexico.  The new health center will serve approximately 2,650 tribal residents and will be a complete replacement of the existing IHS clinic on the Alamo Navajo reservation.  Services provided in this facility include ambulatory care (primary care, specialty care, behavioral health, dental, podiatry, and emergency medical services), ancillary services (laboratory, diagnostic imaging, pharmacy, and physical therapy), preventative care (environmental health, health education, public health nursing, public health nutrition, wellness), additional services (diabetes and woman-infant-children) and associated administrative and building support programs.
The site consists of approximately 41 acres of land. The area required for the health center including parking lots, drives, utility areas, and stormwater management, is approximately 12 acres.  An additional three acres would be required for the geothermal well field.  The 41-acre parcel will also be required to support staff quarters. While the quarter’s design is not part of this project’s scope, it has been determined that a minimum of approximately nine acres will be required for the staff quarters (exclusive of utilities and stormwater).
The new facility will be designated as an Outpatient Facility by the 2018 FGI guidelines. The new construction will be in accordance with IBC 2021, Type II-B construction. Occupancies are designated primarily as Business Group B.
Additional work requirements will be provided in the finalized Statement of Work. Period of Performance is 1200 calendar days after issuance of a Notice to Proceed.

Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. (Leidos Biomed), a subsidiary of Leidos Corporation, a Delaware corporation with offices in Frederick, MD is the Operations and Technical Support (OTS) contractor for the National Cancer Institute at Frederick.  The effort to be performed will be part of Leidos Biomed’s Prime Contract 75N91019D00024 that has been issued by the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD.
Description of Work - National Cancer Institute’s Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) is the largest public repository of comprehensive tumor proteomic datasets. It’s a cloud-based resource that collects, harmonizes, and hosts mass spectrometry-based proteomic data along with corresponding metadata across a variety of tumor types from programs including Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC) and the Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) network. The PDC data portal is open access and provides end users with appropriate compute capacity to support large-scale analytical capabilities. PDC also maps datasets, when available, to corresponding genomic and/or imaging data within the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC).
Objectives - The objectives of Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) are (1) to make cancer-related proteomic datasets easily accessible to the public, and (2) to facilitate direct multi-omics integration in support of precision medicine through interoperability with accompanying data resources (such as genomic and medical image datasets). The scope of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to operate, maintain and improve the existing Proteomic Data Commons (PDC). The PDC has been available to the scientific community for over 3 years. It is part of the CRDC data ecosystem and is expected to utilize all the relevant CRDC interoperability requirements such as Cancer Data Aggregator. Areas influenced by these requirements include system design, PDC data model, data sharing, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and communication activities. Since the PDC has already completed development and has been released in a production environment, the main activities will be continued operations of PDC along with necessary enhancements due to the new data types (such as metabolomics) and to improve data utilization and interoperability.",3,Positive,"This Special Notice has been released to notify Offerors of an Amendment to Solicitation S23-072.

Description of Work - National Cancer Institute’s Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) is the largest public repository of comprehensive tumor proteomic datasets. It’s a cloud-based resource that collects, harmonizes, and hosts mass spectrometry-based proteomic data along with corresponding metadata across a variety of tumor types from programs including Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC) and the Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) network. The PDC data portal is open access and provides end users with appropriate compute capacity to support large-scale analytical capabilities. PDC also maps datasets, when available, to corresponding genomic and/or imaging data within the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC).
Objectives - The objectives of Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) are (1) to make cancer-related proteomic datasets easily accessible to the public, and (2) to facilitate direct multi-omics integration in support of precision medicine through interoperability with accompanying data resources (such as genomic and medical image datasets). The scope of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to operate, maintain and improve the existing Proteomic Data Commons (PDC). The PDC has been available to the scientific community for over 3 years. It is part of the CRDC data ecosystem and is expected to utilize all the relevant CRDC interoperability requirements such as Cancer Data Aggregator. Areas influenced by these requirements include system design, PDC data model, data sharing, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and communication activities. Since the PDC has already completed development and has been released in a production environment, the main activities will be continued operations of PDC along with necessary enhancements due to the new data types (such as metabolomics) and to improve data utilization and interoperability.
